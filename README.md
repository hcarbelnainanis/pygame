Overview
Welcome to the Snake Game! This classic arcade game allows players to control a snake as it moves around the game board, consuming food to grow longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake grows longer, the game becomes increasingly challenging.

Scoring System: Keep track of your score as you consume food.
Increasing Difficulty: The snake grows longer as it consumes food, making it more challenging to avoid collisions.
